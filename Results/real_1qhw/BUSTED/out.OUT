Analysis Description
--------------------
BUSTED (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic
diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted jointly
to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide
evidence of episodic diversifying selection. Assuming there is evidence
of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1), BUSTED will also
perform a quick evidence-ratio style analysis to explore which
individual sites may have been subject to selection.

### Branches to test for selection in the BUSTED analysis
* Selected 25 branches to test in the BUSTED analysis: `sequence1, sequence2, sequence3, sequence4, sequence5, Node8, Node6, sequence6, sequence7, Node12, sequence8, sequence9, Node16, sequence10, sequence11, sequence12, sequence13, Node23, Node21, Node19, Node15, Node11, Node5, Node3, sequence14`


### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
* Log(L) = -5524.63, AIC-c = 11115.44 (33 estimated parameters)

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -4946.52, AIC-c =  9973.82 (40 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0930

### Improving branch lengths, nucleotide substitution biases, and global dN/dS ratios under a full codon model
* Log(L) = -4946.52, AIC-c =  9973.82 (40 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0931

### Performing the full (dN/dS > 1 allowed) branch-site model fit
* Log(L) = -4924.42, AIC-c =  9937.80 (44 estimated parameters)
* For *test* branches, the following rate distribution for branch-site combinations was inferred

### Performing the constrained (dN/dS > 1 not allowed) model fit
* Log(L) = -4925.82, AIC-c =  9938.55 (43 estimated parameters)
* For *test* branches under the null (no dN/dS > 1 model), the following rate distribution for branch-site combinations was inferred

|          Selection mode           |     dN/dS     |Proportion, %|               Notes               |
