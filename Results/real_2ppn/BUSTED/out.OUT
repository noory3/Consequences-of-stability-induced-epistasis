Analysis Description
--------------------
BUSTED (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic
diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted jointly
to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide
evidence of episodic diversifying selection. Assuming there is evidence
of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1), BUSTED will also
perform a quick evidence-ratio style analysis to explore which
individual sites may have been subject to selection.

>Loaded a multiple sequence alignment with **14** sequences, **108** codons, and **1** partitions from `/home/noor/Stokes_AntiStokes/real_2ppn/BUSTED/2ppn_numbered.txt`


### Branches to test for selection in the BUSTED analysis
* Selected 25 branches to test in the BUSTED analysis: `sequence1, sequence2, sequence3, Node3, sequence4, sequence5, sequence6, Node12, sequence7, Node11, sequence8, sequence9, Node19, sequence10, Node18, sequence11, Node17, sequence12, Node16, Node10, Node8, sequence13, Node7, sequence14, Node6`


### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
* Log(L) = -2609.97, AIC-c =  5286.44 (33 estimated parameters)

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -2132.80, AIC-c =  4347.82 (40 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0331

### Improving branch lengths, nucleotide substitution biases, and global dN/dS ratios under a full codon model
* Log(L) = -2132.80, AIC-c =  4347.82 (40 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0330

### Performing the full (dN/dS > 1 allowed) branch-site model fit
* Log(L) = -2105.43, AIC-c =  4301.56 (44 estimated parameters)
* For *test* branches, the following rate distribution for branch-site combinations was inferred
