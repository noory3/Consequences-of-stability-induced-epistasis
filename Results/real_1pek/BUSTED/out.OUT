Analysis Description
--------------------
BUSTED (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic
diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted jointly
to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide
evidence of episodic diversifying selection. Assuming there is evidence
of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1), BUSTED will also
perform a quick evidence-ratio style analysis to explore which
individual sites may have been subject to selection.

>Loaded a multiple sequence alignment with **12** sequences, **276** codons, and **1** partitions from `/home/noor/Stokes_AntiStokes/real_1pek/BUSTED/1pek_numbered.txt`


### Branches to test for selection in the BUSTED analysis
* Selected 21 branches to test in the BUSTED analysis: `sequence1, sequence2, sequence3, sequence4, Node7, sequence5, sequence6, sequence7, Node13, sequence8, sequence9, Node16, Node12, Node10, Node6, sequence10, Node5, sequence11, sequence12, Node20, Node4`


### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
* Log(L) = -7345.46, AIC-c = 14749.09 (29 estimated parameters)

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -6712.32, AIC-c = 13497.45 (36 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0857

### Improving branch lengths, nucleotide substitution biases, and global dN/dS ratios under a full codon model
* Log(L) = -6712.31, AIC-c = 13497.43 (36 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.0849

### Performing the full (dN/dS > 1 allowed) branch-site model fit
* Log(L) = -6442.65, AIC-c = 12966.30 (40 estimated parameters)
* For *test* branches, the following rate distribution for branch-site combinations was inferred

### Performing the constrained (dN/dS > 1 not allowed) model fit
* Log(L) = -6462.25, AIC-c = 13003.45 (39 estimated parameters)
* For *test* branches under the null (no dN/dS > 1 model), the following rate distribution for branch-site combinations was inferred

|          Selection mode           |     dN/dS     |Proportion, %|               Notes               |
